# About Nexos

Nexos is an operating system written entirely in assembler.

It is supported by multiple processors. Some of them are based on the 80x86, ARM, RISC-V and Z80 architectures. Only the basic instruction set is used for portability between variations of a processor architecture.

The system is supported by mobile platforms, computers and PCs.

# Features

Features vary from version to version due to architecture and processor bits, but all follow the unix portable operating system interface standard (POSIX).

The 8-bit versions of the operating system attempt to comply with POSIX 1990.

16-bit versions with POSIX 1996

32-bit versions with POSIX 2001

64-bit versions try to keep up with the latest version of POSIX.

# Application Binary Interface

The ABI used by the system is the same as Linux.

# Application development tools

Comes with a C and C++ compiler called NCC (Nexos C Compiler) that allows programming for multiple architectures.

It comes with an assembler called NAS (Nexos Assembler) whose syntax is based on Flat Assembler but with the ease and flexibility of Netwide Assembler.

It comes with a linker called NLK (Nexos Linker) that generates machine code for different architectures. It has a script language called NKLS (Nexos linker Script).

It comes with a BASIC interpreter.

# User applications

Comes with a calculator, web browser and package manager.
